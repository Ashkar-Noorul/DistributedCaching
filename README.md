# DistributedCaching
ASP.NET Core supports both in-memory application-based caching and distributed caching. Unlike in-memory caching, which resides within the application, distributed caching is external to the application. It does not live within the application itself and does not need to be present on the same server.

A distributed cache can be shared by one or more applications, instances, or servers, making it ideal for scenarios where you have multiple instances of your application running. It helps ensure that all instances have consistent data. However, it’s highly recommended placing your distributed cache instance as close to your application as possible to minimize network latency.

Like an in-memory cache, a distributed cache can significantly improve your application’s response time. However, the implementation of a distributed cache is specific to the application, meaning there are multiple cache providers that support distributed caching.

The most popular distributed cache provider is Redis. Redis offer robust features and scalability options, making it suitable for various applications and deployment scenarios.

In this article, we will focus on building an ASP.NET Core application that caches data to a Redis instance, which runs locally on a Docker Container

## Pros & Cons of Distributed Caching

**Pros**
1. Data Consistency: Ensures data is consistent across multiple servers.
2. Shared Resource: Multiple applications or servers can use a single instance of a distributed cache like Redis, reducing long-term maintenance costs.
3. Persistence: The cache remains intact across server restarts and application deployments as it resides externally.
4. Resource Optimization: Does not consume local server resources, preserving them for other application processes.
5. Scalability: Distributed caches can easily scale to handle large amounts of data and high traffic volumes.
6. Fault Tolerance: Many distributed caching solutions offer built-in fault tolerance and replication features, enhancing system reliability.
7. Advanced Features: Distributed caches often come with advanced features like data eviction policies, expiration, and clustering.

**Cons**
1. Latency: Response times can be slightly slower compared to in-memory caching due to network latency, depending on the connection strength to the distributed cache server.
2. Complexity: Setting up and managing a distributed cache can add complexity to the system architecture.
3. Cost: There can be additional costs associated with running and maintaining a distributed cache, especially for managed services or larger setups.
4. Network Dependency: Performance is dependent on network reliability and speed. Network issues can impact cache performance.
5. Security Concerns: Ensuring secure communication between your application and the distributed cache requires additional configurations and considerations.
6. Data Synchronization: In highly dynamic environments, ensuring data synchronization between the application and the cache can be challenging.

This comprehensive list provides a balanced view of the advantages and potential drawbacks of using distributed caching in your applications. As you know, System Design is a game of trade-offs. There is no single BEST Approach. Everything depends on the purpose and scale of your application
